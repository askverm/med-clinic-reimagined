              The very hands that once held ours â€” our parents, grandparents â€” are now left to face 
              medical emergencies, emotional loneliness, and everyday struggles... alone.

              "I started CareSaathi after seeing how helpless families feel during a sudden emergency. 
              They have money. They have phones. But they didn't have access. And more than that â€“ 
              they didn't have peace of mind.
              <br /><br />
              So I asked myself â€“ what if there was a way where even if you're sitting miles away 
              from your loved ones, you could still ensure they're safe, cared for, and emotionally supported?
              <br /><br />
              CareSaathi is my answer to that question â€“ and perhaps yours too."
